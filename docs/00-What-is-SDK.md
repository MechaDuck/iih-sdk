# IIH SDK Software Development Kit (SDK)

## Introduction

The IIH SDK Software Development Kit (SDK) stands as a cornerstone in transforming the landscape of Industrial Edge App development for the Industrial Information Hub (IIH). In contrast to the challenges developers faced in the past, such as scattered edge app development processes, lack of in-line testing capabilities, absence of resource allocation/management suggestions during the development stage, and a steep learning curve, the SDK emerges as a solution to streamline, speed up and enhance the entire development lifecycle.

## Before SDK

- **Scattered Edge App Development Processes:**
  Before the SDK, developers grappled with a disjointed approach to edge app development, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies across projects.

- **No In-Line Testing Capabilities:**
  The absence of in-line testing capabilities hindered developers from efficiently testing and refining their applications during the development phase.

- **No Resource Allocation/Management Check:**
  Developers lacked tools or suggestions for effective resource allocation and management during the early stages of development.

- **Huge Learning Curve:**
  The traditional methods posed a significant learning curve, making it challenging for developers to quickly adapt and contribute.

## What SDK Provides

The IIH SDK SDK addresses the historical pain points and inefficiencies associated with traditional development approaches. Here's how it adds value:

- **Speeding up App Development:**
  The SDK accelerates app development through efficient Code Generation, allowing developers to focus on the core business logic.

- **Time-Saving Artifact Setup:**
  Developers save time by leveraging automated artifact setup, eliminating the manual effort required in configuring development environments.

- **Overhead-Free Configurations:**
  SDK mitigates the overhead of complex configurations, providing a more streamlined and developer-friendly experience.

- **Automated .app Builds:**
  Automation of the .app build process ensures consistency and reliability in the application packaging phase.

- **Optimizing Resource Utilization:**
  The SDK optimizes resource utilization, ensuring efficient use of computing resources during both development and execution.

### Current Capabilities

As of now, the IIH SDK provides the following capabilities:

- **App Generation for Python:**
  Developers can generate Python-based applications with ease, leveraging the power and flexibility of the Python programming language.

- **Emulation with IIH Apps:**
  The SDK allows developers to emulate and test their applications seamlessly within the IIH ecosystem.

- **Automated Packaging:**
  The packaging process is automated, simplifying the deployment of applications to the Industrial Edge.

### Future Enhancements 

In the upcoming months, the IIH SDK is set to introduce advanced features:

- **GenAI-Based Business Logic Generation:**
  Incorporation of GenAI-based approaches for automating business logic generation, further reducing development time.

- **Automated Deployment:**
  Streamlining deployment processes with automated deployment workflows, enhancing efficiency and reliability.

- **Support for Node with TypeScript:**
  Extending language support to Node with TypeScript, catering to a broader range of developers and use cases.

## Advantages of Combining IE Platform + IIH with SDK

Integration of the Industrial Edge (IE) platform with IIH and the SDK brings forth numerous advantages:

- **Improved App Development Experience:**
  The seamless integration enhances the overall app development experience, providing a cohesive and efficient workflow.

- **Increased Value of the IIH:**
  The combined power of the IE platform, IIH, and the SDK adds substantial value to the IIH ecosystem, making it a robust and comprehensive solution.

## IIH SDK Current Flow

1. **Developer:**
   - Creates an app using SDK's UI.
   - Code generated from templates.
   - Starts devcontainers and adds business logic code.

2. **Coding Phase:**
   - Code with business logic.
   - Test and debug from devcontainer.
   - Code ready for deployment.

3. **Packaging and Deployment:**
   - Creates a standalone .app file.
   - Side-loads that .app file to Industrial Edge Management.
   - Installs it on the Industrial Edge device.

## IIH SDK Flow (Phase 2 - Future expansion)

1. **Developer:**
   - SDK prompt generates code with business logic.
   - Developer can adapt and modify according to their use-case scenario.

2. **Test Environment:**
   - Test environment generated with dependencies running.
   - Code ready for deployment.

3. **Packaging and Deployment:**
   - Creates a standalone .app file.
   - Side-loads that .app file to Industrial Edge Management.
   - Installs it on the Industrial Edge device.
